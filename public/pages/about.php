                Björn Sigurson founded RuneStone after leaving his long-time career in finance to create accessible, timeless jewelry that modern man and women can buy for themselves, on their own terms.

                As a European entrepreneur, Björn values sharing his heritage and the Scandinavia' unique design perspective. Every piece is designed in Norway (his current residence) and produced ethically in the european Union,
                with the intention of being renewed and passed on by community for years to come.

                RuneStone is a celebration of good design, evolution, tradition, and bountiful Scandinavian mythology.

                Our jewelry is made of unique materials, many of which are recycled. We're hand selecting the beads,
                colorful embroidery and unique fabrics from markets hidden away throughout the European Union and from around the world.
                Combining these materials together creates one of a kind jewelry.
